# habrochaites-stomata
This is the master branch for all code for all experiments from both Eduardo Ramirez & Mary Lee (these projects also shares a lab notbook)

Eduardo's project includes all of the data collected by Axelle Wagner & Lauren Headland and focuses on the differences in stomatal and pavement cell densities between the habrochaites introgression lines and the two parents

Mary's project revolves around the changes observed in stomatal and pavement cell densities in the two parental lines under insufficient water conditions.

Both contain phenotype and LICOR data sets.

This github repository is an attempt to 'clean up' the code previously created for thier projects
